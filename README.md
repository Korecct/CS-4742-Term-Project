# How to get Started

## How to Train the model - 

run - 
`python train_model.py`

wait until it is finished training, it will save checkpoints in case something happens so not much progress is lost

## Run the flask app to start the server - 

run - 
`python app.py`

## Then startup a new console - 

Make sure to do this in a seperate console  that app.py is running in otherwise it won't work

run - 
`python model_test.py`
